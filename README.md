## Technologies

### NextJS

Built initially with HTML5, TailwindCSS and a bit of JavaScript.

Updated to Next.js to include a blog, improve SEO, use components and facilitate reutilization.

Although initially used Lighthouse (Google Chrome Console Tool) and RespImageLint to detect images issues that affect page performance and user experience after the transition to Next.js the majority of the work was made by the framework and the Image Component.

### Tailwind CSS

TailwindCSS was a tool very useful to follow a design system and create a custom designed website while taking advantage of its utility-first characteristic to fast prototyping and update.
