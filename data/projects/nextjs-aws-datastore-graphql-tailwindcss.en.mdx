The GraphQL model is the center, from it you can generate the types used for AWS DataStore to implement your CRUDL operations.

AWS Amplify makes it easy to deploy ReactJS apps to the cloud. But in this scenario what I needed was the offline or local-only
capabilities offered by AWS DataStore. The cloud persistence is at one push distance.

The project is conceived as a free tool to explore some exit strategies for stock trading, but as a result of being free, there is the
constraint to make the operational cost 0 or very low.

The resulting solution saves the data locally in your browser, but not in the cloud. The Amplify API is never pushed to the cloud and the
app keeps working as a complete offline app.

Also it includes a blog to improve visibility for what Next.js has better SEO capabilities than pure React.
