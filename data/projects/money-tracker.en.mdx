Amazon Web Services (AWS), among other cloud computing vendors, enable our teams to focus on the creation of value to the client. No more
struggle with the physical infrastructure means that we can have more time and resources to tackle our business goals.

A flexible price system where you pay for what you use and a generous free tier makes the entry point in AWS available to many budgets.

With AWS Amplify you can use the GraphQL scheme to guide your development life cycle from prototyping to production. A fully managed
hosting service with several CI/CD workflows available for your deployment needs.

From the design of the API until production you can use many AWS services as construction blocks for your app. If you need to add
authentication/authorization Cognito comes to your help. If you need to include offline capabilities then use DataStore... AWS AppSync
lowers the friction around fast iterations of your GraphQL API.

For web/mobile development all is provided with AWS Amplify from which you can include API (GraphQL/Rest), Auth, Storage, AI/ML, CI/CD,
Lambda Functions. All from the comfort of your terminal with the CLI or the Admin UI if you prefer a visual interface.

Many libraries make easy work with your preferred stack: JavaScript, Android, Flutter or iOS. UI components are available for ReactJS,
Angular, Vue, Web Components and React Native.

This project was built mostly with AWS Amplify, GraphQL and ReactJS. Try it `sign in` or use `user: test, password: test2020`
