This project provided a possibility to use CSS Grid while trying to get a responsive website. It includes inline javascript for creating several images of different sizes to fill the grid. This techniques came from the Wes Bos's great course CSS Grid. Also the usage of images was a good intro to analyzing the impact of images size, format and aspect-ratio in the page's performance.

Gimp made easy the process of creating images at specified dimensions. Also imageoptim allows more images's compression to achieve better performance.

Lighthouse (Google Chrome Console Tool) and RespImageLint were very useful to detect images issues that affect page performance and user experience.
