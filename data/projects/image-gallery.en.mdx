This project provided a possibility to use CSS Grid while trying to get a responsive website. It includes inline javascript for creating
several images of different sizes to fill the grid. This technique came from the Wes Bos's great course CSS Grid. Also the usage of
images was a good intro to analyzing the impact of images size, format and aspect-ratio in the page's performance.

Gimp made the process of creating images at specified dimensions easy. Also imageoptim allows more images's compression to achieve better
performance.

Lighthouse (Google Chrome Console Tool) and RespImageLint were very useful to detect images issues that affect page performance and user
experience.
