Amazon Web Services (AWS), among other cloud computing vendors, enable our teams to focus on the creation of value to the client. No more struggle with the physical infrastructure means more time and resources to tackle our business goals.

A flexible price system where you pay for what you use and a generous free teer makes the entry point available to many budgets.

From prototyping to production the GraphQL scheme guides your development life cycle. A fully managed hosting service with several CI/CD workflows available for your deployment needs.

Since the creation of the API until production you can use many AWS services as construction blocks for your app. If you need to add authentication/authorization Cognito comes to your help. If you need to include offline capabilities then use DataStore...AWS AppSync lowers the friction around fast iterations of your GraphQL API.

For web/mobile development all is provided with AWS Amplify from which you can include API (Graphql/Rest), Auth, Storage, AI/ML, CI/CD, Lambda Functions. All from the comfort of your terminal with the CLI or the Admin UI if you prefer a visual interface.

Many libraries make easy work with your preferred stack: JavaScript, Android, Flutter or iOS. UI components are available for ReactJS, Angular, Vue, Web Components and ReactNative.
