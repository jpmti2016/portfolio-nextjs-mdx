This project explores the basics properties of CSS Grid and how it allows responsive layouts. The idea also came from the Wes Bos's great
course CSS Grid.

It makes it possible to think about image quality, size, format, aspect-ratio and how it affects the page performance and user experience.

It was also useful to practice the usage of Gimp, imageoptim, Lighthouse and RespImageLint.
