Personal website portfolio created to showcase my projects, skills and to be a way to interact with clients and developers.

Built initially with HTML5, TailwindCSS and a bit of JavaScript.

Updated to Next.js to include a blog, improve SEO, use components and facilitate reutilization.

TailwindCSS was a tool very useful to follow a design system and create a custom designed website while taking advantage of its
utility-first characteristic to fast prototyping and update.

The project was designed to provide a great user experience and have good performance. Gimp and imageoptim were tools that made easy
the process of creating the images needed to respond at different viewport's width and compressing them to achieve better performance.

Although initially used Lighthouse (Google Chrome Console Tool) and RespImageLint to detect images issues that affect page performance
and user experience after the transition to Next.js the majority of the work was made by the framework and the Image Component.
