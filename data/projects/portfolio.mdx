Personal website portfolio created to showcase my projects, skills and to be a mean to interact with employers, clients and developers.

TailwindCSS was a tool very useful to follow a design system and create a custom designed website while taking advantage of its utility-first characteristic to fast prototyping and update.

The project was designed to provide a great user experience and have good performance. Gimp and imageoptim were tools that made easy the process of creating the images needed to respond at different viewport's width and compressing them to achieve better performance.

Lighthouse (Google Chrome Console Tool) and RespImageLint were very useful to detect images issues that affect page performance and user experience.
