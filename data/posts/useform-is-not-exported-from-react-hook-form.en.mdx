## TLDR

To fix `Attempted import error: 'useForm' is not exported from 'react-hook-form' (imported as 'useForm')` add `'use client'` to your client component wrapper like:

```
'use client'
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'

export function AuthenticatorClient({ children }) {
  return <Authenticator>{({ signOut, user }) => <>{children}</>}</Authenticator>
}
```

## Fixing `"Attempted import error: 'useForm' is not exported from 'react-hook-form' (imported as 'useForm')"`.

When using AWS Amplify, Amplify UI and NextJS you may encounter the following error:

```
./node_modules/@aws-amplify/ui-react-core/dist/esm/components/FormCore/FormProvider.mjs
Attempted import error: 'useForm' is not exported from 'react-hook-form' (imported as 'useForm').
```

It is realted to having to use a client side component in a server component, like the Authenticator from the [Amplify UI library](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/getting-started/installation).

To solve the error add `'use client'` to your client component wrapper, as explained in the NextJS documentation, when
[using third party packages and providers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns) that use ReactJS client-only features like `useState` and don't implement the `'use client'` directive.

```
'use client'
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'

export function AuthenticatorClient({ children }) {
  return <Authenticator>{({ signOut, user }) => <>{children}</>}</Authenticator>
}
```
