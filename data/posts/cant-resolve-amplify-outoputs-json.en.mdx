## TLDR

To fix `Error: Module not found: Can't resolve '../../amplify_outputs.json'`:

- In the Amplify console update the app hosting build settings to add the build command `- npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID`:

	```yml
	version: 1
	backend:
	  phases:
	    build:
	      commands:
		- npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
		- npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID
	frontend:
	  phases:
	    build:
	      commands:
		- npm run build
	  artifacts:
	    baseDirectory: .next
	    files:
	      - '**/*'
	  cache:
	    paths:
	      - .next/cache/**/*
	      - .npm/**/*
	```

If you get permission errors like "AccessDeniedError: Unable to get backend outputs due to insufficient permissions.Resolution: Ensure you have permissions to call cloudformation:GetTemplateSummary":

- Attach the `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` policy (under AWS managed policies) to the amplify-policy for the user created in the IAM Identity Center as explained in the [Amplify docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/account-setup/), or to the role / group that you are using for the project.
