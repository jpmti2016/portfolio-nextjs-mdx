## TLDR

Update the **AWS Route 53 domain’s nameservers or, A and CNAME record types** with the values provided by **Vercel** under
`ProjectName / Settings / Domains` after you added a domain to the project. It will show the info needed to configure
`greatdomain.com` and redirect to `www.greatdomain.com` or vice versa. After you tried to add the domain to your project
unsuccessfully that information will also be sent to your email explaining what to do. Vercel allows you to configure A (recommended)
and CNAME records.

## Some background

As of June 30 2021 **AWS Amplify** doesn't support all **Next.js** features. So if you are eager to use the great **Image Component**,
**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, **Optional Catch All Routes** or other **Next.js 10+ features** with AWS Amplify
[you have to wait](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/server-side-rendering-amplify.html#nextjs-version-support) and
your best option is to **deploy to Vercel**.

But we know that time is a scarce commodity and we have to keep the features pipeline running for the sake of the business.

The website’s **SEO** and performance optimizations were due yesterday. Our research indicates that Next.js is a must for better Developer
Experience and User Experience. The [Image Component and the Automatic Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10#built-in-image-component-and-automatic-image-optimization)
impact directly the user experience [avoiding Cumulative Layout Shift and being lazy loaded](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
by default so increasing the page’s speed.

Next.js does the heavy lifting for us mortal developers: image resizing, optimization and serving in modern formats from a variety of
sources. Image optimization on demand that doesn't increase build times.

Sorry AWS but I need those features and can’t wait for you. You have great services yet your server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities and
Next.js integration don’t match my use cases. But at least you got the domain registered, and if it keeps working as expected with the
Vercel deployment I will not [transfer it to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains).

## Vercel side

Assuming that you have your project deployed to Vercel, you only have to add the custom domain. If you need to do advanced configuration
you can [check the documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains).

For now I will try to keep it simple based on my experience.

On the project’s setting on the Vercel dashboard, there is a **Domain** link where you can add your `greatdomain.com`. If you don’t have a
domain you could also [purchase it with Vercel](https://vercel.com/domains?limit=24), AWS Route 53 or your provider of choice.

After you click the **Add** button, the service will indicate any invalid configuration for the **A Record** or the **Nameservers**
(in each tab) and it will recommend what to do.

Also it will send you emails with the values for the **A** and **CNAME** record types, and the **nameservers** needed to update your
provider DNS records.

**For `greatdomain.com`**

> To configure the Domain, set the following record on your DNS provider (recommended):
>
> | name | type | value       |
> | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
> | @    | A    | 76.76.21.21 |
>
> Alternatively, you can also change your Domain's nameservers to the following intended set:
>
> - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
> - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`

**For `www.greatdomain.com`**

> To configure the Domain, set the following record on your DNS provider (recommended):
>
> | name | type  | value                |
> | ---- | ----- | -------------------- |
> | www  | CNAME | cname.vercel-dns.com |
>
> Alternatively, you can also change your Domain's nameservers to the following intended set:
>
> - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
> - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`

Follow by an email with the expected **_successfully configured_** after all the hard work!

If you are unfamiliar with the DNS terminology relevant to this task, here is the explanation from Vercel, you can
[check the full guide if there is no rush](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains).

> ... you will be presented with different methods for configuring it, depending on whether it is an apex domain (example.com) or
> subdomain (docs.example.com).
>
> Apex domains can be configured with an A record, while subdomains can be configured with a CNAME record. Both domain types can also be
> configured using the Nameservers method.

## AWS Route 53 side

Allways after updating the Nameservers or, the A and CNAME records you have to **wait some time for the changes to be applied**.

The waiting time is different for each provider. You should call customer support if it takes too long.

With AWS Route 53 it took me a few minutes to see my website live again.

### Nameservers

The name servers associated with your AWS Route 53 registered domain should be found in your
`Route 53 / Domains / Registered Domains / greatdomain.com / Name Servers`. They look like:

- ns-123.awsdns-31.net
- ns-4567.awsdns-63.co.uk
- ns-432.awsdns-50.com
- ns-7654.awsdns-50.org

Replace those _awsdns_ name servers on the `Route 53 / Domains / Registered Domains / greatdomain.com / Name Servers / Add or edit name servers` with the Vercel’s Intended Nameservers that is recommended under the Nameservers tab. They should look like:

- ns1.vercel-dns.com
- ns2.vercel-dns.com

### A Record

Copy the **A Record** value from your project dashboard in Vercel. It should look like `76.76.21.21`.

Go to your `AWS Route 53 / Hosted Zones / greatdomain.com / Create Record` (It should be an **A** record by default, if not select an A
type from the Record Type dropdown), and paste it in the field Value. If you need _further information_ for each field you can hit the
**Info** link over the field or consult the [Amazon Route 53 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/?id=docs_gateway). Leave
the **name** empty and it should take a valid default.

Do the same for the **CNAME type**, copy your Vercel CNAME record value `cname.vercel-dns.com` and paste it in the Route 53 Record value
field. The **name** field should be `www` in this case, or what Vercel recommends you.
