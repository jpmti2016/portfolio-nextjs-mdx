## TLDR

This selection of 7 resources covers a broad spectrum of topics about blockchain, that explain it related to the real world, using academic and bootcamp formats. It includes materials from MIT, Berkeley, a16z, and Web3 Foundation. It is intended for people interested in the fundamentals of blockchain and decentralized finance.

## Intro

Getting into Web3, DeFi, and blockchains in general don’t have to be intimidating.

Developers, entrepreneurs and users in general may benefit from many online resources that explain the fundamentals of blockchains, its application to the real world including the finance world and the development of dApps.

I created this selection to facilitate my own learning of Web3 and blockchains, and to complement my skills about creating dApps.

These resources are accompanied by a date of publication as a guide because some are updated continuously, and because Web3 and blockchain evolve very fast, so having some context could help with the learning. The dates may be used as a hint of its level of actualization.

They can be used in any order, complement each other, some are with an academic format and other with a bootcamp format, some lectures are more theoretical, others more practical.

## Blockchain and Money, course, 2018, MIT 15.S12, Prof Gary Gensler

[Blockchain and Money](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) explores topics about blockchain technology fundamentals, cryptography, consensus, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, DApps, applications in the financial sector, regulatory landscape, public policy, etc.

## Cryptocurrency Engineering and Design, course, 2018, MIT MAS.S62, Prof Neha Narula and Tadge Dryja

[Cryptocurrency Engineering and Design](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/media-arts-and-sciences/mas-s62-cryptocurrency-engineering-and-design-spring-2018/) is a dive into the design and functioning of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, cryptography, game theory, and network architecture.

## FinTech: Shaping the Financial World, 2020, MIT 15.S08, Prof Gary Gensler

[FinTech: Shaping the Financial World](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s08-fintech-shaping-the-financial-world-spring-2020/index.htm) explores the ways in which technology is disrupting the financial services industry. Technological trends that include IA, deep learning, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, open APIs. Market structure, participants, regulations and dynamic of change associated with FinTech.

The [Class 5: Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s08-fintech-shaping-the-financial-world-spring-2020/class-5-blockchain-technology-cryptocurrencies/) is about Internet and payments, money, crypto markets, use cases for blockchain, central bank digital currencies, etc.

## Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance, 2013, MIT 18.S096, Profs. Dr. Peter Kempthorne, Dr. Choongbum Lee, Dr. Vasily Strela, Dr. Jake Xia,

[Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/) illustrates math concepts and techniques used in the financial industry.

Cover topics such as yield curve, option price, volatility modeling, portfolio theory and management, quanto credit hedging, etc.

## Fundamentals Decal, 2021, Berkeley, Spring 2021

Include many topics about cryptography, blockchains and economics. Explore blockchain fundamentals from a technical side (cryptography, Bitcoin, technologies) and from a non-technical side (history of digital currencies, laws, organization, trends, community).

Many [versions of the course are available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlockchainatBerkeley/playlists), and the [enrollment for the 2022 version is available on its website](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/spring-2022-fundamentals-decal/).

Also it [has versions in edx.org](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS198.2x+3T2019/home).

## Blockchain Primitives: Cryptography and Consensus, Prof Dan Boneh (Stanford), 2020

[Blockchain Primitives: Cryptography and Consensus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0JdeRzVndI&list=PLM4u6XbiXf5oDP6DFeEoNP5K_Epy1RAx4&index=3) provides a high level view about blockchains and how developers can use them to build decentralized applications.

It is part of the [a16z Crypto Startup School series of lectures and discussions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM4u6XbiXf5oDP6DFeEoNP5K_Epy1RAx4) given by experts to help entrepreneurs learn how to build crypto companies.

## Blockchain for Beginners, Bill Laboon, 2020

> The Web3 Foundation [Blockchain for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxVihxZC42nF_MCN9PTvZMIifRjx9cZ2J) MOOC teaches blockchain from the very basics all the way up to building your own blockchain. The course is led by Bill Laboon, Web3 Foundation’s technical education lead.

> Beginning with the fundamentals - What is a blockchain? How is it stored? What are the different algorithms and protocols that are used in a blockchain? What’s the history of blockchain technology? It goes from absolute zero knowledge of blockchain or cryptography all the way to showing how to produce actual products on blockchain.

## Conclusion

Having a good understanding of the blockchain fundamentals is important when you get into Web3, DeFi, decentralization and privacy preserving technology that also have to be secure and verifiable.

These 7 resources include materials from MIT, Berkeley, a16z, and Web3 Foundation that you can use to reinforce your learning about blockchains and its application in the real world.

The materials have academic and bootcamp formats, useful theoretical and practical insights.
