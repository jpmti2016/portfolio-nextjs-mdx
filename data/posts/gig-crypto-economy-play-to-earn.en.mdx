## The opportunities for all stakeholders are unique and infinite.

The crypto revolution has created a way to share the profit with the community while participating in different endeavors, art collection, gaming, social ownership and investing as part of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), you name it; it is just the beginning, a horde of fans, gamers, investors, curators, collectors, punks, Sci-fi enthusiast, digital explorers, makes their reality transcend to the virtual, to the game, to the metaverse. The time is not just fused with the new space, but allows to reclaim a portion of the gains hence it is not anymore a mere time lost, it is time invested by having ownership of your joy and community interactions, reflected in the value of the characters and items that you own, or the price of the tokens that you stockpile.

By the rules of virtual communities and the nature of the blockchain, there is a way to have a say in the decisions and a portion of the pie. Not anymore a mere customer, gamer or user. No exclusivity to the company, publisher, or gallery.

The decision making hierarchy gets flat, the censure lost by the effect of decentralized organization and functioning, the harvesting of your personal data is phase out by permissionless protocols where you can selectively decide what info to reveal to perform the transaction at stake and still be held responsible for any transgression because everything is stored in the blockchain, unmuttable, transparent, open to be audited by everybody.

## Blockchain and crypto issues, risks and concerns.

Of course there are risks related to a nascent technology that has yet to mature but for a few decades has proven its validity. Blockchain and crypto currencies still have room to improve in security, fraud detection, user entry barriers in terms of usability, learning curve, transactions speed and environmental impact, for name a few.

Different protocols, organizations, and DAOs have different levels of maturity and development. Like in other areas there are people that try to pray on others.

Be cautious, do a diligente research, donâ€™t share your passwords and protect it properly. Be aware of the risks, this new world is not exempt from scams, ponzi schemes like organizations and adventures.

You know the level of risk that you can tolerate, and the level of investment you can afford. But remember it is just the beginning in this new era where you earn while learning exciting stuff, playing your loved titles and making your greatest creations.
