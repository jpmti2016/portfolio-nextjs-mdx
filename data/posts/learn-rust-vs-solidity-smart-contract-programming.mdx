The motivations to learn a programming language vary from person to person.

Considerations may include previous background, tech stack, programming paradigm, documentation, community support, job opportunities and industry interest for just mentioning a few.

## Transferable skills

This is related to the range of blockchains (protocols), platforms, tech stacks, domains and industries supported by the language.

Both Rust and Solidity are used to program smart contracts, but for Solidity it is its only use.

The smart contracts written by Solidity are intended to run on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Examples of blockchains that use Solidity are Ethereum, Monax, Hyperledger and Burrow.

Rust is used to code many type of systems:

- Web browser engines (Servo and Gecko).
- Operating systems (Redox, Theseus).
- Game engines (Bevy, Amethyst).
- Runtime environment for JavaScript (Deno).
- File system manager (Stratis).
- Apps (Figma, Dropbox).
- Used by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Discord, Cloudflare, etc.

## IDE, frameworks and libraries

[Rust has first-class editor support](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) in many IDE and editors like VS Code, SublimeText3, Atom, Intellij Idea, Eclipse, Vim, Emacs and Geany.

It uses Cargo as a build tool, useful to install packages created by the community, to test and to deploy your code, and to create documentation for your code. With Rustfmt you get automatically formatted code, and coherence across the team. Clippy helps juniors and experienced developers write idiomatic code and enforce standards.

Rust also [has an online playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) ready for you to start your coding journey.

For the Solana ecosystem you can use Anchor. [Anchor is a framework](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html) that provides a few amenities: Rust crates and eDSL, IDL specification, TypeScript packages for generating clients from IDL, and CLI and workspace management tools.

## Tech stack

### The Solana tech stack includes:

- JavaScript Runtime Environment: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- NodeJS Version Manager: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- Solana Tool Suit: [Install solana tools suit](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) depending on your preferred workflow.
- Browser Wallet: [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) as recommended but [Solana supports other wallets](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide).
- Smart Contract Language: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- Framework: [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html).
- Testing Library: [Mocha](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-mocha).
- UI Library: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) or your preferred.

### The Ethereum tech stack includes:

- JavaScript Runtime Environment: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- NodeJS Version Manager: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
- Browser Wallet: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html).
- Smart Contract Language: [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
- Frameworks: [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).
- Testing Library: [Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/),
- UI Library: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) or your preferred.
- Client Libraries: [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- API Layer: [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/)

Development, Adoption and Community

Solidity is still under development (proposed by Gavin Wood in 2014, and developed by a team lead Christian Reitwiessner). On September 9, 2021, the version 0.8.9 was released. Is recommended to use the latest release in your contracts deployment to mitigate issues related to breaking changes, new features and bug fixes.

Blockchains
Used on Ethereum, Monax, Hyperledger, Burrow or blockchains that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Transferable skills
Used to develop smart contracts that run in the EVM.
